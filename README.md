# Hawaii Surf Forecasts

Surf forecast site for Hawaiian Islands. Built with React/TypeScript and using my Flask API to get raw NOAA buoy data.

Need to access NOAA Wave Watcher 3 model data for future forecasts.
Need to split raw buoy data and solve for wave height as a function of frequency and power to get individual swell components.

Can put buoys with buoy info on Leaflet map as an extra.
